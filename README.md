Showcase Repositories👍
Here are some of my showcase repositories:

https://github.com/Kemeh-30/Data-Representation-Project  :This is a simple Flask web application with a RESTful API, utilizing Flask-RESTful for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving items. The application also includes web pages to consume the API, allowing users to perform CRUD operations on the data.

https://github.com/Kemeh-30/Fund-data   :This Python script analyzes the Iris dataset using the pandas library for data manipulation and matplotlib/seaborn for data visualization.
https://github.com/Kemeh-30/PFDA-Project   :This repository contains a Python script for analyzing red wine quality using the pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib libraries. The script reads a dataset (red-winequality.csv), explores its characteristics, visualizes relationships between variables, and generates synthetic data for further analysis.
